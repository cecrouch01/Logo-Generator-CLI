  # Logo Generator CLI

  ## Description
  This is a CLI application that will allow the user to create a simple logo that has three characters and is in the shape of a Square, Circle, or Triangle. The user will be able to decide what color the text is and the shape is. The application will create an svg file that corresponds with the data generated by the user. This can be used to create a simple logo that will be used on a website or act as a place holder for a logo on a website that is being created.
